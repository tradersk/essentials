      <p>  The duration of the course will be around 2 hours. I am charging for the simplicity and effectiveness of my technique, not for the class duration. Since it’s purely a damn straightforward setup, you can definitely understand within a short period of time. The session can be extended if you are having on-going queries. But remember to practice it in the live market for at least 6 months. I will provide support after the session. You can ping me for any doubts.

I won't be blabbing stuff like How to identify candlestick patterns, Harmonics, how to use Fib retracement etc. You can get the generic stuffs freely from YouTube.</p>

      <h1 class="trig">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	  <h2 class="trig">1. "Swing trading with less efforts” is it a clickbait?</h2>
      <p>
      No. The most important aspect of trading isn't really when you buy or sell, but what you do before, during, and after. As a Trader, you need to have the skill to sit and do nothing. What happens to the price of the scrip you are trading, isn't in your control, but how you react is. During my class, you will come to understand the significance of this technique and how it can revolutionize your approach to trading. This a simple yet unique method that you won't find anywhere else.
